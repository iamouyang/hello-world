git config --global http.proxy http://proxyuser:proxypwd@proxy.server.com:8080
change proxyuser to your proxy user
change proxypwd to your proxy password
change proxy.server.com to the URL of your proxy server
change 8080 to the proxy port configured on your proxy server
If you decide at any time to reset this proxy and work without proxy:

Command to use:

git config --global --unset http.proxy
Finally, to check the currently set proxy:

git config --global --get http.proxy


Set 'all_proxy' environment variable for your user. Required by curl.

export all_proxy=http://DOMAIN\proxyuser:proxypwd@proxy.server.com:8080

Set 'https_proxy' environment variable for your user. Required by curl.

export https_proxy=http://DOMAIN\proxyuser:proxypwd@proxy.server.com:8080

I am not sure if this has any impact. But I did this and it worked:

git config --global http.sslverify false
